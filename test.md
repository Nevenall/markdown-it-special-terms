# These are tests for developing {special term} plugin

{plain level 1 term}

{{plain level 2 term}}

{{{Plain level 3 term}}}

{{{{four is a term with escaped braces}}}}

**{strong term}**

{**term with asterix**}

`{back tick term}`

{`term with backticks`}

\{escaped term\}

\{escaped with a newline
how does this parse?\}

{multi-line text 
can also be a special term.}

{but not if it has

a paragraph break in it}

{{this gets parsed as a level 1 term}

{this also gets parsed as a level 1 term}}

These are empty braces {}

A sentence with {two} different {terms} should also parse

A more complex block like {this{should be a level term}}
